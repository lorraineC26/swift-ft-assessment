# SWIFT Frontend Assessment

This project is a frontend assessment built using Vue.js. It allows users to upload documents and preview them before finalizing the upload process. The main features include:

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents either by `dragging and dropping` them into the designated area or by `selecting them using a button`.

- **Preview**: Once a document is selected, users can preview it to ensure it is the correct file they want to upload.

- **Upload**: After previewing the document, users can click on the upload button to finalize the upload process. Once uploaded, the `file names are displayed` with a `delete button` next to each name.
